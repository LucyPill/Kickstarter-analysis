# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns:
Purpose: Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends and help Louise to start a successful kickstarter campaign. We will perfome two analysis: one based on goals and another based on launch date and make recommendations based in our findings.


# Analysis and Challenges:
 ## Analysis:
In order to do this analysis, I performed two analyses. One analysis was based on goals and the other was based on launch date. For each one of this analysis, I filtered the data to get the data that was revelant to the anlysis, and created pivot tables using these data. Finally, I created charts that allows me to visualize the data to make educated conclusions and recommedations to Louise.
 ## Challenges I encounter: 
 The challenges I encountered were mostly familiarity with excel. I have never used excel to this level. My use of excel has been mostly to do simple tasks. This was the first time, that I have ever worked with spreasshet this size. It was quite intimidating at the beginning, but the instructiones were clear and self explanatory so it was easy to follow them. 


# outcomes Based on Goals:
Based on the analysis of the outcome based on goals, it is hard to conclude or see a trend that allows us to make a conclusion as the the precentage successful is the mirror image of the percentage fail. The data is all over the place and there are not clear trends.

# Outcomes based on Launch Date:
Based on the analysis of theather outcome based on launch date, we can clearly conclude that the date of a launch plays a more important role on how successful a campaign will be. We can see that there is an upward trent that starts at the end of March - beginning of April and peaks in May with over 100 successful campaigns. From the end of May all the way through Sepetember, we see a decline of successful campaigns. We can conclude that Spring and Summer are the two seasons where more campaigns that are successful. This success can be due to weather. Depending on where the play is, is it indoors? or outdoors? lets say it is an outdoor play, people will more likely will go to an outdoor play during the summer. In winter time, the only plays are indoors. So we can say that Spring and Summer there are higher chances of success.

# Limitations of this data set:
A possible limitation of this data set could be the sample size. Even though we have a spreasheet with several categories we are concentrating on the the theater category an dthis category has atotal of 1369 data points. The sample size is not too small but we can always benefit from a larger sample size.

# Possible tables of graphs we can create:
We can create a pivot table based on years and the parent category for theater and have a visualization of this data. Perhaps look at a especif year and try to understant what happened during that year that made the outcome more/less successful. We can create tables to compare the most successful vs the fail vs in certain criteria that allows us to make a more educated conclusion.
